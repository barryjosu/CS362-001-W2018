I found three bugs in my teammate's code.

1. In Appt.java, on line 125
There is an off by one error here; where it checks that startMonth>11, it should be checking for >12. 

2. In CalDay.java, on lines 59-61
day++, month++, and year++ should just be day, month, and year. There is no reason to increment them.

3. In CalendarUtil.java, on line 33
|| should be &&, since we need to ensure that it is a leap year AND February before making the month longer.
